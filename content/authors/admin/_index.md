I am interested in the mechanisms and treatment of addiction by MRI, EEG, TMS, TES. I am curious about the resilience and cognitive flexibility, especially the maladaptive learning ( e.g., goal-directed [model-based] and habitual control [model-free] behavior ) in addiction patients (substance use & behavior addiction). Now I am trying to explore whether the maladaptive learning tasks and algorithms of reinforcement learning have a cross-diagnostic role in mental illness.
